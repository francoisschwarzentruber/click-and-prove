    <h1>Help</h1>
       Proofs are represented by so-called tree proofs. Each node is of the form:

<br/>
        <proof>
            <proofs>
                <proof>
                    <infer>Premisse 1</infer>
                </proof>
                <proof>
                    <infer>Premisse 2</infer>
                </proof>
            </proofs>
            <infer>Conclusion</infer>
        </proof>

        This is read: "From premisse 1 and premisse 2, I prove the conclusion".






        <h2>Why this tool?</h2>

        Tired with proofs written in text? 
        Tired of searching Equation 4 and Lemma 5.3.2 when you read "Equation (4) and Lemma 5.3.2 leads to...". 
        The advantage here is that the premisses used to prove a conclusion are graphically near.
