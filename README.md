# Click-and-prove

This tool is an explorer of mathematical proofs in the form of proof trees. Clicking on statements shows how they are proven.

## Technical aspects

Proofs are described in the folder `proofs` in `.proof` files in a text format that is inspired by the way proofs are described in the package `bussproofs` in LaTEX. This tool reads these files and display interactive proof trees.
